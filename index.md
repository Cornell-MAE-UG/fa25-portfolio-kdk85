## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore undergraduate student at Cornell University majoring in mechanical engineering, planning to emphasize in hydrologic engineering. 

As a mechanical engineering major and someone who has worked on a mixture of both wet lab and design projects, my experiences have given a wealth of interdisciplinary knowledge, from PCR protocols to the mapping of water quality on ArcGIS to cathodic protection techniques. I aim to apply these skills toward advancing sustainable water treatment and distribution as well as the exploration of the impacts of hydroclimate processes on water infrastructure. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.

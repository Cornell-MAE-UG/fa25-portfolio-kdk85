## Qualitative Description
This heat exchanger system consisted of a cold reservoir (blue ice water in a cooler) and a hot reservoir (red heated water with an immersion heater) connected to a heat exchanger. Water from each reservoir was pumped through the heat exchanger and exited into two empty water buckets, where outlet temperatures were measured.

## How it Works
In a heat exchanger, the hot stream draws warm water from the hot reservoir and transfers heat to the cold stream from the cold reservoir. In both parallel- and counterflow configurations, the cold stream exits at a higher temperature than it entered, while the hot stream exits at a lower temperature than it entered. If the system is treated as a closed system, the pumps supply mass flow, the heater supplies energy in the form of heat, and the heat exchanger enables heat transfer between the two streams.

## Applicable Equations

**Mass Conservation (Steady Flow):**  
This equation states that the mass flow rate of each fluid stream remains constant between the inlet and outlet of the heat exchanger, indicating steady operation with no mass accumulation or leakage.

**Energy Balance (Heat Exchanger):**  
This equation expresses conservation of energy, where the heat lost by the hot fluid equals the heat gained by the cold fluid plus any heat losses to the surroundings. When losses are negligible, the heat transfer between the two fluids is equal in magnitude.

**Entropy Generation:**  
This equation quantifies the entropy generated due to irreversible heat transfer between the hot and cold fluids. It accounts for the entropy decrease of the hot stream and the entropy increase of the cold stream, providing a measure of thermodynamic inefficiency.

**Energy Balance (Reservoir):**  
This equation describes the time-dependent energy balance of the hot fluid reservoir supplying the heat exchanger, accounting for heat input from a heater, work added by a pump, heat removed by the exchanger, and the resulting change in internal energy.

## Design Change
If the system design is changed for the heat exchanger to be in counterflow instead of parallel flow, the effectiveness of the exchanger should increase. In parallel flow, both streams enter at the same end and flow in the same direction, so the hottest and coldest fluids only interact at the inlet. In counterflow, the streams flow in opposite directions, so each section of the heat exchanger maintains a larger temperature difference, improving heat transfer.
